Bloc Jams
--------------

Bloc Jams is a project that was a part of the Bloc curriculum that was used to gain experience with creating users, interacting with CRUD actions,
adressing authorization concerns, and changing user access based on different situations.

There are photos and a write up on the project here: [BlocJams Repository](https://github.com/dwaite498/bloc-jams-angular)

Explanation
-----
I created this project with guided explanations and frequent code snippets provided by Bloc. This was the capstone project of my initial Front End training and
I consider it an early example of a completed JS Angular app.

Learning Outcomes
-----
In this project I was learning about the Angular framework and the basics of how it works. The frontend aspect of programming was something I struggled with.

The scenario for this project is that a client requested a music player app that was quick and responsive and allowed users to select from a list of albums and then
select a song from inside the album.

This was the first time that I started to really understand how to use the MVC framework in Angular JS. I went into the project with a lot of apprehension and was
able to walk away with some confidence in my ability to learn programming outside of a tutorial where I just copied 100% of the code.
