Bloc Jams
--------------

Bloc Jams is a project that was a part of the Bloc curriculum that was used to gain experience with creating users, interacting with CRUD actions,
adressing authorization concerns, and changing user access based on different situations.

Explanation
-----
I created this project with guided explanations and frequent code snippets provided by Bloc. This was the capstone project of my initial Front End training and
I consider it an early example of a completed JS Angular app.

Problem
-----
The scenario for this project is that a client requested a music player app that was quick and responsive and allowed users to select from a list of albums and then
select a song from inside the album.
