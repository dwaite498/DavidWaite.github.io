Bloc Jams
--------------

Bocipedia is a project that was a part of the Bloc curriculum that was used to gain experience with creating users, interacting with CRUD actions,
adressing authorization concerns, and changing user access based on different situations.

Explanation
-----
I created this project with minimal provided code from Bloc. I had several coding mentors who assisted me throughout the process.

Problem
-----
The situation surrounding this project is that a client wanted an app that would allow users to create both paid and free accounts with which to collaborate
on editable wiki pages. The client requested admin access to all posted wikis, private and public, and the ability to curate them as necessary for content.
