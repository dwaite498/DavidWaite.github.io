How do I describe Myself? It is a question that I have been having to think about a lot lately. The act of categorizing myself used to be easy. I was a history student, an amatuer historian, a gamer, and a runner. The categories I used to define myself for most of my formative years no longer apply. I still run, but my pursuit of history as a field of study has fallen by the wayside. How do I describe myself as I push into a new field that I do not have years of study and time invested in.

The transition away from history began when I moved down to Durham in 2013. I had just finished an internship at a county Museum in Virginia and felt like I could take on anything. My goal in Durham was to get a masters in history and then get job at a museum. As I researched, I realized that the job market for history was terrible. You had to have connections to get the jobs that there were. This realization was demoralizing. I had put my entire life on a path and I had to accept that I was not good enough to make that path happen. I had not pursued a career, I had pursued a dream without getting out of the dream and throwing myself into making it a reality.

From the next three years I drifted around trying to figure out where I could go to be successful. I never had a problem getting a job or doing it well. I worked as a meat cutter in grocery, A window cleaner, and a substitute teacher. Each time I tried to see if I could make a career out of it, it only took me a few months each time to figure out that they were not where I wanted to be. The longest I lasted in pursuing a career was as a meat cutter. I was on the track to be made a meat department manager but realized when it came time that it was not something I actually wanted. The hours were extremely long, the responsibilities were more than what could be accomplished in only 40 hours, and in grocery(especially the meat department) holidays are crunch time, not time to spend with family and friends. These different opportunities gave me a solid foundation in soft skills and reminded me that learning new skill sets is something that never gets old.

I always dabbled in IT, but never considered it for a career. I have build computers from scratch, played around with Linux, and been the go to IT guy in my family but the idea to go into IT full time was alway pushed aside as impossible. Sometime in early 2016 the topic came up and I mentioned to my wife that I was considering giving programming a try. Her response was one of relief that I finally got the idea to go for it instead of just talk about how I “Should have gotten a Computer Science Degree”. Once I realized that I always talked about IT but never actually pursued it, I realized that I should give it a try. I did a few tutorials and did some research, and loved it.

Now that I have spent almost a year getting into programming, and loving Ruby on Rails, I am happy to say that the previous jobs and pursuits had not gone to waste. I love working with people, and if there is anything that will teach you how to deal with difficult people it is working in the grocery industry. Handling team based objectives is something that all of my jobs have done and I am very anxious to get on a development team and set some goals to reach for. A year ago I may have described myself as a manual laborer, a failed historian, or a man with no purpose. Today I can proudly say that I am a programmer.
