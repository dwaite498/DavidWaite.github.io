When it comes to learning new skill sets, I have always enjoyed the early speed of the basics. Any new topic is simple when you only scratch the surface. The real challenge doesn’t begin until I fully immerse myself and get past the basics and into understanding the real scope of the topic. I have spent most of my life jumping from that surface learning of one skill, to another. I never learned how to buckle down and work through the hard part to get to the satisfaction of true mastery. 
This is not to say I never became good at anything, I had little trouble when it came to becoming as knowledgeable of a student of history as I could. Every moment I had for many years was spent learning about the historical narrative. The political intrigue of Athens or Rome, comparisons between different cultures and their military theory and tactics, the mass migrations of people that took place countless times over the millennia, all aspects of history that I could enjoy with little effort. When I went to college I had a four year plan: learn history, become a history expert, graduate, profit? This lack of a long term plan coupled with my inability to pursue any other skill set to a level of competence, left me unprepared to enter the world beyond college.
I always thought that maybe I should learn how computers work on a software side. I have built a few computers in my day, and the hardware was easy; this pin set plugs into that matching port rinse, repeat. The software was something that I knew I wanted to learn but I pushed the idea aside, looking at programming as some sort of unattainable magic that is only for smarter and more talented people. I was wrong on many counts, and I am proud to say that I am learning things that pull back the curtain on the mysteries of programming every day.
The preconceived notions of programming being impossible were easily displaced by the ease of entry into basic programming. Simple tutorials on sites like Codecademy and Khan Academy have come a long ways in allowing people to get a feel for programming without having to take the time learning how to set up a dev environment, a task that even I find somewhat daunting after almost a year. Once I had decided to go for programming as a career, I list this as my fifth career idea I had tried to pursue in the previous years’ time, I realized that I would have to stick with it to the end. There was no going back and my ability to succeed as a programmer would mean success or failure for my family.
