I would love to say that I am all business and everything about me is programming all day, every day. However, That is not the case and I also like to get out
in the sun and climb some mountains. I find any high point of land first as a challenge to overcome, and second as a place to get a sweet view for new photos. 
Another hobby of mine is researching into beekeeping. I don't have a house that I can keep bees at, yet. But once I do I will have as many hives as I will have
the time to care for. For me all of my hobbies are like programming, climbing a mountain is a lot like a good development cycle; Setting up a new hive from a
Nuc to harvesting that sweet sweet honey can have similar hair pulling experiences as debugging a broken app. I really don't look at any part of my life to be separate from any other
A passion for one thing, regardless of what that is, can carry over knowledge and wisdom to another activity. If I am going to do any of the things I am passionate about,
I am going to do it well and have fun doing it.
